	<h1>Code Log 2: CSS Measuring Units</h1>
    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <p>Explain the difference between absolute and relative CSS length units:</p>
    <textarea cols = "80" rows = "8">
Absolute units are set values that remain unchanged no matter what system it is being run on. This means they are great when you have precice measurements you can work with. Examples of Absolute units include px, cm, mm, in, ect. Relative units are a little bit different, as the actual size of the units depends on many factors, such as font, viewing size, or line height. This makes relative units great for dynamic enviornments. Examples of relative units include %, em, rem, vw, ect.
    </textarea>
    <h2>Part 2</h2>
    <p>Pick any three of the units and describe the units in detail:</p>
    <h3>px, pt</h3>
    <textarea cols = "80" rows = "4">
px and pt are both absolute units. px measures in pixels and pt is about 1/72 of an inch. Both of these measurements are very small and good if you want to be very precice or add a lot of detail.
    </textarea>
    <h3>%</h3>
    <textarea cols = "80" rows = "4">
% is an easier unit to understand, as it takes the percent of the width from the parent element declared and takes up that much room. This would also mean it is a relative unit good for adapting to different screen sizes. 
    </textarea>
    <h3>vw, vh</h3>
    <textarea cols = "80" rows = "6">
vw and vh are relative units that function very similarly to %. The largest difference is how vw and vh are relative to the browser window and % is relative to the parent element. This means you should use vh and vw when you want a percent of the total browser window. Also, vw is width of the screen while vh is height of the screen.
