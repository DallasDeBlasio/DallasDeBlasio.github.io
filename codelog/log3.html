    <h1>Code Log 3: CSS Media Queries</h1>
    <h2>Question 1</h2>
    <p>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</p>
    <textarea cols="75" rows="5">
A CSS media query checks the conditions of the users browser and device enviornment and will change the code executed to give the user the best expierence. This is very useful if someone wants to access a site from their phone, then again on their laptop. Each time they go on it they will get the same quality despite how different the device enviornment is. This works because of the checks such as width and height of the device.

    <h2>Question 2</h2>
    <p>What "media features" are supported by media queries and what do they do? Pick any 4 to explain.</p>
    <textarea cols="75" rows="8">
Max-width:  This will check the width of the screen side of the device being used to access the site. If it exceeds the max height listed, then it will not run the code block. Additionally, you are allowed to use any measurement system for this.
Min-width:  This also works a lot like the max-width. in this case, instead of checking the device screen side for a height that exceeds the chosen measurement, it will check that it is less than the chosen measurement. Once again, the developer can use any measurement system.
Orientation:    This will check the orientation of the device. It can be either portrait or landscape. This is useful for mobile, because you can hold the device either vertical or horizontal. 
Max-height: This works a lot like the max-width. In this case, instead of checking if the device screen is wider than the allowed values, we check if it is higher. If the height is too much, it will skip the code block. Once again, any measurement can be used. 
I also think it is important to note that any of these can be combined to set up multiple conditions for the users device.
